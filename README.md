## Prompt

![Fullstack Diagram](./client-server-database-diagram.svg)

You’ve been given a diagram (see above) showing the three core layers of a fullstack application:

- Frontend – a React application that users interact with
- Backend – an Express server that handles logic and communication
- Database – a PostgreSQL database that stores persistent data

Imagine you’re explaining how these layers work together by using a real-world example: Instagram.

Your task:

1. Explain how Instagram works using the three-layer diagram.
   * What happens when a user opens the app, scrolls through their feed, likes a post, or uploads a new photo?
   * Walk through how data flows from the frontend to the backend and to the database—and back again.

2. Come up with an analogy to help someone new to coding understand these layers.
  * You might compare the system to something like a restaurant, a library, or even a post office—anything that helps make the roles of each layer intuitive.
  * Make sure your analogy maps clearly to the roles of the frontend, backend, and database.

3. Reflect on the value of this separation.
  * Why do we separate concerns into these layers?
  * What would go wrong if we tried to do everything in one layer?

Audience: Imagine you're writing this for someone who's just starting out in web development and wants to understand how modern apps work.

Length: Around 400–600 words.
